# Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows-Clustering
Unsupervised ML on Netflix Dataset 

In our project, Netflix Movies & TV Shows Clustering, we were able to analyse and perform an unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm for the unlabelled datasets. The dataset we were provided with contains several columns and other numerical features. We were also asked two questions that could be answered from EDA.


The EDA was done extensively as we needed to derive good insights to support our claim and hypothesis. We were able to answer the two questions that followed along with the EDA, country-wise trend analysis on content and genre; and also to analyse if Netflix was focusing more on Shows rather than Movies.


After we performed EDA, both univariate and bivariate analysis, we have prepared our text columns by following basic text cleaning, stopwords removal, tokenisation and stemming. After the text columns were ready, we selected only features or words that were important using TF IDF Vectorisation and also reduced dimension. 


The prepared text columns were clustered after selecting an optimal value from elbow plots. Finally, we used K Means to cluster our dataset into 9 distinct clusters and we were also able to encode or label the dataset accordingly.

Subsets of dataset formed from clustering were analysed and word clouds were plotted, after which we used interactive Plotly visualisation to represent the cluster. 

Finally, a simple recommendation system was also tried out, the future scopes for the projects were also identified.
